## Abstract

Smartphone usage among teenagers has seen a dramatic increase over the past decade, raising growing concerns about digital overdependence and its potential psychological, social, and academic consequences. This project explores the detection of potential smartphone addiction among teens by applying anomaly detection techniques to usage pattern data. Using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, we analyze daily app usage, screen time, sleep duration, and activity logs to identify behavioral anomalies that may signal addictive tendencies. By leveraging unsupervised learning models such as Isolation Forest and Autoencoders, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and outliers in the data. The outcome of this work could support the early detection of problematic phone use and inform interventions by parents, educators, and mental health professionals. Our study emphasizes the role of data science in addressing contemporary behavioral health challenges in the digital age.


## Introduction

Smartphone addiction among teens is a growing concern worldwide. Excessive use of social media, gaming apps, and late-night usage can affect mental health, sleep, and academic performance. Early identification of anomalous usage patterns can help in designing interventions. This project uses anomaly detection techniques to detect teens whose usage patterns deviate significantly from the norm.
